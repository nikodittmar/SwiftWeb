## ‚ú® Features

SwiftWeb is packed with features designed to make web development in Swift a breeze.

  * **Powerful Routing:** SwiftWeb's routing system is both powerful and easy to use. It supports all major HTTP methods, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. You can define static and dynamic routes with parameters, and even create nested routes and resource-based routes for your controllers.
  * **MVC Architecture:** SwiftWeb follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, helping you to organize your code in a clean and maintainable way. You can create controllers to handle request logic, models to represent your data, and views to render your HTML.
  * **Swift-Based Templating:** Say goodbye to complex templating languages. With SwiftWeb, you can write your views in plain HTML and embed Swift code directly into your templates using a simple and intuitive syntax.
  * **Database Integration:** SwiftWeb comes with a powerful and easy-to-use database layer called SwiftDB. It provides a simple and elegant way to interact with your database, with support for models, migrations, and more.
  * **Command-Line Interface:** SwiftWeb includes a command-line interface (CLI) that makes it easy to create new projects and manage your application. The CLI includes a project generator that sets up a complete project structure for you, so you can start coding right away.
